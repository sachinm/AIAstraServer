# AGENTS.md — how agents work in this repo

Applies to every coding agent (Claude, Fable, Gemini, Cursor, Codex) working on AI Astra.

## Work in parallel by default

Never let one task block the rest of the plan.

0. **Run commands in background mode.** Any command that can take more than a few seconds (tests, `tsc`, builds,
   `prisma generate`, installs, git on large trees, scripts) runs with the agent's background/"run in background"
   option. While it runs, keep working on the next thing that does not need its result; read its output when it
   finishes. Do not sit waiting on a foreground command.

Do not work through a plan one item at a time when its items are independent.

1. **Split first.** When a plan has two or more pieces that do not need each other's results and do not edit the same
   files, start each extra piece as its own background session (or sub-agent) on its own branch/worktree, then do the
   remaining piece yourself. Do not wait for them; keep going.
2. **Unblock yourself.** A blocker that is not a decision only Sachin can make (a missing fixture, a review, a side
   investigation, a doc, a refactor another piece needs) goes to the background too, while you continue with what you can.
3. **Brief it fully.** Each background piece gets: the goal, the files it owns, the files it must not touch, which
   migration number/timestamp it uses, and what "done" is (branch, commit, tests green). Two writers never edit the same
   file; when both need one shared file (e.g. `prisma/schema.prisma`), say where each one appends.
4. **Planning stays planning.** A planning/review session (e.g. Fable on a design doc) only reads code and writes its one
   doc. It does not change code.
5. **Merge is yours.** Background sessions commit on their own branch and stop. The session that started them checks the
   diff, runs tsc and tests, and merges `--no-ff` into `develop`.
6. **Ask only for real decisions.** Production, AWS, database writes, pushes, deletes and money need Sachin's OK
   (through the deploy session for deploys). Everything else, decide and report.

## Branches and checks

- Every feature/fix/docs branch is cut from `develop` and merged back into `develop` with `--no-ff`. `main` gets release
  merges only.
- Before a merge: `npx tsc --noEmit` and the unit tests for the area (`npx vitest run tests/unit/<area>`).
- Dev sessions stop at "committed and merged into local `develop`". Pushing, Lambda deploys and Amplify rebuilds go
  through the deploy session.
- Migrations are written, never applied, without Sachin's explicit OK. Never run terraform.

## Tracking files

- `TEST.MD`: tests to perform. Executed tests save screenshots in `docs/screenshots/<folder>/` with sequence-numbered
  names (`01-…png`).
- `QA-LIST.MD`: tested items with their screenshots, for review.
- `AUTO-FIX.MD`: straightforward bugs queued for direct fixing.
- `SLOW-UI.MD`, `SLOW-UX.MD`, `SLOW-AGENTIC-FLOW.MD`: items that need slower review.

## Product rules agents must keep

- Radha (pyjhora, `AIAstra_Radha`) is the only source of astrological data. Node computes nothing astrological.
- English only for now.
- Declined topics (`declined_topics` table, docs/reading-engine/18) are never facilitated or passed to any agent.
- Never print secrets.
