# TODOS: every finding, until it is fixed

The shared list for all agents and sessions on AI Astra (server, Radha, web). Rule in `AGENTS.md`: any error, bug or
finding you do not fix on the spot goes here, or in a named doc linked from here, before your session ends. Read this
file before starting work in an area. When an item ships, delete it and say where the fix went in the commit.

Each item says: what is wrong, where, how we know, who holds it now, what done means.
Priority: **P0** wrong readings or data; **P1** blocks or risks a release; **P2** real but can wait; **P3** nice to have.
Status: `open`, `in progress (<owner>)`, `blocked (<on what>)`.

Findings below were filed 2026-10-31. "Reported" means an agent read it and I have not verified it myself.
This file was recreated after the 2026-10-31 checkout loss; the deploy session's additions of that morning are to be
re-applied by it.

---

## P0: wrong readings or data

- **Main checkout wiped on 2026-10-31 08:17** by a `git worktree add` with an empty path (reported by the analysis
  session). `.git`, `.env`, `docs`, `evals`, `AGENTS.md`, `Dockerfile` and more deleted; unpushed local commits lost;
  `src`, `prisma`, `scripts`, `tests` survived. Rebuilt from a backup copy and GitHub by the deploy session. Status: in
  progress (deploy session). Done: `develop` rebuilt and pushed, every lost branch recreated, `.env` restored by Sachin,
  the worktree rule in AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md.
- **Stored dossiers may not be Radha's.** `kundli_facts` (24 rows) and `transit_snapshots` (24 rows, built 2026-10-25) look
  like the local build (`scripts/backfill-local-facts.ts` plus `docs/reading-engine/drafts/radha/`), not the deployed
  Lambda. `src/reading/data/store.ts` and `src/reading/packs/transitTable.ts` read them, so the chat path depends on them.
  Lead on Sachin's wrong readings; not proven. Found by the deploy session. Status: in progress (reading-dev: comparison
  agent). Done: comparison report, types deployed, both tables rebuilt for every kundli.
- **Radha does not serve `facts` or `transits`.** `src/reading/data/factsBuilder.ts` and `engineClient.ts` ask for them;
  neither is in Radha's `export.py`. Status: in progress (reading-dev, Radha `feature/reading-p1`, files
  `facts_export.py`, `transits_export.py`). Done: real exports, deployed, with a real `engine_commit`.
- **The 2026-10-28 Sachin reading used that dossier.** Part of it rests on `facts.json`, and it derived varga dignities from
  a sign table on the reading side. Treat it as unconfirmed. Status: blocked (comparison). Done: differences listed in
  `side-session-notes/.../sachin/dossier-vs-radha-comparison.md` and the reading rewritten from Radha tables.
- **G1 golden fixture is a stand-in.** `evals/fixtures/G1/facts.v1.json` has `engine_commit: draft-stand-in`, so tests that
  agree with it prove little. Reported. Status: open. Done: regenerated from deployed Radha.
- **Node computes astrology.** Rule: "always Radha returns it". Status: in progress (reading-dev, branches
  `fix/timeline-houses-from-radha` (done, to be recreated after the loss) and `fix/node-astrology-to-radha` (agents
  writing)). Sites, reported by audit:
  - `src/reading/timeline/foundation.ts`: `houseFrom`, `houseOfSign` (removed on the branch)
  - `src/reading/layers/sections.ts`: `signLords` applies natal sign lords to prashna and tithi pravesha charts and drops
    co-lords, which can give wrong lords; `occupants` and the house sign taken from the first occupant
  - `src/reading/nodes/convergence.ts` ~160-196: fortune tier from Node tables for dignity, good houses, gochara
  - `src/reading/timeline/foundation.ts`: `ownsOf` gives Rahu and Ketu houses Radha does not (switching changes scores);
    `lordPlacement`
  - `src/reading/packs/selector.ts` `aggregateToAd`; `src/reading/timeline/dashas.ts` ~88 end dates;
    `src/reading/chartData/dashaShape.ts`; `src/reading/facts/current.ts`; `src/reading/timeline/activate/transits.ts`;
    `src/reading/timeline/activate/doubleTransit.ts`

- **Stored `kundli_facts` carry wrong values** (proved 2026-10-31 by the comparison in
  `sachin/dossier-vs-radha-comparison.md`): Rahu's D1 dignity (friend, should be enemy; six vargas wrong too),
  shadbala ranks (sorted on rupas, not the ratio: the Moon is the weakest planet, not Venus), ishta/kashta 0 for the
  Sun and Moon (not a real value, should be null), yogas for empty houses (Sunapha, Duradhara and others), doshas left
  out (Manglik from Venus and the Moon; G1's Ghata and Shrapit), and the kundlis' saved lat/lon truncated to whole
  arc-minutes by the backfill. Signs, houses, nakshatras, varga signs, arudhas, karakas, argala and dasha dates are
  right. Fix: clear the saved lat/lon/tz (database write, needs Sachin's OK), deploy Radha `facts`, then
  `npm run facts:backfill -- --force`. Status: blocked (Radha deploy).
- **pyjhora reports yogas for empty houses** (vesi, vosi, ubhayachara, sunapha, anapha, duradhara; `horoscope/chart/yoga.py`
  counts an empty house as occupied). Proved on two charts. The served `yogas` table has the same wrong rows; the other
  ~90 yogas need the same check. Status: in progress (reading-dev, Radha `feature/reading-p1`).
- **Served `dignities` gives Rahu Ketu's row** (`const.house_strengths_of_planets[7]`): Rahu reads debilitated in Taurus
  and exalted in Scorpio. Status: in progress (reading-dev).

## P1: blocks or risks a release

- **`tests/unit/reading/chartData.test.ts` fails on `develop`.** "an old failure… means refetch" expects a failure one minute
  old not to refetch, but a6cb60a set `FAILED_RETRY_MS` to 1 s (`chartData/store.ts:94`). Doc 38 is changing this file; check
  there first. Status: open. Done: the test and the constant agree.
- **`chatRouting.test.ts` fails when the reading tests share one process** (the form this file recommends for memory), and
  passes alone. Its "no dossier" tests get a demo answer, so `READING_FACTS_SOURCE` is leaking from another test file. Seen
  2026-11-01. `specialistFailures.test.ts` also hit its 5 s limit once in that mode. Status: open. Done: the shared-process run is green.
- **Prompt registry changes the schema from the request path.** `src/reading/prompts/registry.ts` `ensurePromptSchemaAndSeed`
  runs `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE TRIGGER` on `system_prompts` during a chat turn. That bypasses "migrations are
  written, never applied", and on a cold Lambda it adds up to 21 statements to the first question. Found reading the code,
  2026-11-01. Status: open. Done: a migration holds the DDL; the code only reads.
- **The `aiastra-ops` AWS key is invalid** (`InvalidClientTokenId`, 2026-11-01), so the live Lambda's `READING_FLOW` and models,
  and CloudWatch timings, could not be read for doc 40. Status: open (deploy session). Done: a working read-only profile.
- **Doc 39 needs a live bench before it is turned on.** Reader quality and every speed in doc 39 §5 rest on two stored data points
  per model. `npm run bench:oracle -- --live` costs under $1. Status: open (needs Sachin's OK). Done: §5 holds measured numbers.
- **Migration M18 (`reading_m18_agent_responses`) must be applied before `READING_FLOW=oracle`.** Without it the journal logs a failed
  write and loses the agent rows; answers are unaffected. Status: open (deploy session, Sachin's OK).

- **Release order for house counts.** With `fix/timeline-houses-from-radha` merged but `house_counts` not deployed, real
  kundlis build without Narayana (S4), without Narayana rows in S7, and with no 6/8/12 drop; the report's notes say so.
  `TIMELINE_ENABLED` is off by default. Order: deploy Radha, apply migration, catalog sync, fetch table per kundli.
- **Migration numbering.** `reading_m16_house_counts` (unapplied) shared the timestamp `20261031100000` with
  `transit_ephemeris_cache` (applied, keep it). `feat/catalog-radha-reading-types` adds M17. Renumber M16 and M17 after
  the applied one when the branches are recreated. Status: in progress (reading-dev).
- **All-kundlis override must run once, after the Radha deploy.** `store.ts:149` refetches `kundli_data` when calc_version
  differs, but this does not touch `kundli_facts` or `transit_snapshots`, which need their own rebuild. Status: blocked
  (Radha deploy). Owner of the run: deploy session.
- **Local memory.** Running `tsc` and vitest together ran out of memory and killed a test file. Run them separately:
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npx tsc --noEmit`; `npx vitest run <area> --pool=forks --poolOptions.forks.singleFork`.
- **`.env` lost with the checkout.** Not in git or any worktree. Values live in Render (database) and the Lambda
  `aiastra-server-api` env config; Sachin restores the file. No values in this file.

- **`transit_snapshots` has no refresh command.** `transits:build` builds only when nothing is stored; the local rows
  cover lookups to about 2027-10-24. To refresh: delete the rows (database write) or raise `TRANSIT_SNAPSHOT_VERSION`,
  then run `transits:build`. Status: blocked (Radha `transits` deploy).
- **`facts` and `transits` now exist in Radha** (uncommitted, `feature/reading-p1`): LAHIRI only (pyjhora's Vimshottari
  start ignores the requested ayanamsa); yoga and dosha names changed ("Manglik Dosha"); `transits` returns all
  lunations (~50, was 13); the server must send `as_of`, `vargas`, `scope`, `from`, `to` as params; `chartCatalogSync`
  will list them as unknown. The server's "unsupported" check does not recognise the new 400 for other ayanamsas.

## P2: real, can wait

- **The web does not call `POST /api/chat/prewarm`.** It should fire it without waiting on a `propose` event, and label the reader
  pills (`R08` → "Vimshottari periods"). Without it, a clarified question whose horizon was answered re-runs timing readers,
  which is the difference between about 7 s and about 11 s (doc 39 §5). Status: open (web session).
- **Answer text arrives in one burst.** First token came within 5 ms of the end on both stored runs (`reading_runs`), and doc 24
  saw the same. So streaming gives no early text at these sizes, and "first token" budgets (doc 12) measure nothing. Status: open.
  Done: confirmed live whether Gemini or our path holds it, and doc 12's budgets restated as complete time.
- **Only the oracle flow has a cost cap.** Single and graph flows have none: a 3-subject graph question could reach about $0.43
  (doc 40 §3). `READING_DAILY_BUDGET_USD` in doc 05 §6 was never built. Status: open. Done: the guard also wraps those flows, or they are retired.
- **Only the oracle flow scrubs engine names from output.** The rule is prompts only in the single and graph flows, despite a23a734's
  message ("enforce engine-name redaction"); `grep` finds no output filter there. Status: open. Done: one filter on every flow.
- **Clarifier model spend is not counted against a question's cap.** Bedrock `gpt-oss-120b` has no row in `llm/models.ts` `PRICES`, and its
  usage is not kept (under $0.001 per question, doc 23). Status: open. Done: priced from the AWS page and seeded into the guard.
- **Stored tables lack fields doc 33's curricula use:** star lord per planet (`varga.d1` gives the nakshatra name only), bhava chalit, and
  `near_cusp`. Readers R07 and R08 report these as gaps. Status: open (Radha session). Done: served, and the curricula restored.
- **The 6/8/12 friction counts between dasha levels have no source.** Doc 26 Pass 3 and doc 33 R8 use them; Node may not count, and
  `house_counts` was not in the stored rows read 2026-11-01. Status: open. Done: read from `house_counts` once fetched per kundli.
- **Planet names differ between tables:** `karaka.chara` says `Raagu` where `dignities` says `Rahu`. A reader or the layer count can treat one
  planet as two topics. Status: open (Radha session). Done: one spelling.
- **G1's catalog fixture has only 5 of the 35 types the readers use**, so `npm run bench:oracle` sends them thin tables. Status: open.
  Done: fixture regenerated from deployed Radha (same work as the G1 P0 item above).
- **Too few stored runs to measure:** 2 readings with timings in 21 days in `reading_runs`. Status: open. Done: enough staging traffic for percentiles.

- **`dasha.tara` fails for kundli de3223e3.** "module returned no periods", same on retry. pyjhora's `tara.py` seeds from planets
  in the kendras and returns nothing when there are none, which most likely explains it (chart not opened). Fix: return an
  empty, marked not-applicable result, not a server error. Status: open (reading-dev, on `feature/reading-p1`).
- **`transit_range` step=day** is confirmed live in the deployed catalog; the server's `transitRangeParams` does not pass
  `step`. The deploy session plans to use it for the shared daily store.
- **`annual.tithi_pravesha_dasha` stays at two levels.** Natal dashas now serve three; the year's dasha does not.
- **Timeline build hash.** `foundation.hash` is dossier-only, so `timeline_builds.dossier_hash` does not show whether a
  build had `house_counts`.
- **Arudha Lagna agreement.** The count now comes only from the table; nothing flags a table and dossier that disagree.
- **Legacy rows.** 80 `legacy` rows in `kundli_data` (10 types x 8 kundlis), which look like deactivated duplicates. Ids not checked.
- **Parked draft.** `docs/reading-engine/drafts/node-compute-parked/buildDossier.ts` still holds `houseFrom`. Delete once
  `facts` ships.
- **Worktrees to clean after merge.** `AIAstra_Server-timeline-houses`, `-node-astrology`, `-radha-types`,
  `AIAstra_Radha-reading-p1`. Their `.git` files point at the deleted `AIAstra_Server/.git/worktrees/`, so their git is
  broken; the file trees are intact and are the source for recreating the branches. The server ones hold a `node_modules`
  junction: `rmdir` it before removing the folder.
- **Radha repo logs.** `src/jhora/logs/` and `__pycache__` are untracked in Radha and not ignored.
- **Served `bhava` method 3 (Sripati)** treats house centres as starts: house 1's cusp 169.3 instead of 334.2, planets one
  house early (`drik._bhaava_madhya_new`).
- **biodata `vedic_weekday` is one day late for afternoon births** (Sachin: Wednesday, really Tuesday).
- **biodata `place` truncates coordinates to whole arc-minutes** (`export.py`), and `scripts/backfill-local-facts.ts` reads them back.
- **G1 transit fixture**: two nakshatra changes dated a day late; lunations stop at 2027-04; doc 09 says Ketu leaves Leo
  2026-12-05, Radha gives 2026-12-04.

## P3: nice to have

- pyjhora's Kemadruma and Sunapha checks count Rahu and Ketu, which classical rules exclude (decides G1's Kemadruma).
- pyjhora's neecha bhanga rule 1 checks the wrong sign and runs only on raja yoga pairs (`raja_yoga.py`).
- Served `dignities` and `benefic_malefic` use the stronger co-lord as `lord` (Ketu as 9th lord), which a Parashari reading misreads.
- Served `d1` shows "Indra Chapa" as Aries when it has no value.

## Planned work Sachin has asked for (not bugs)

- **Life reading model for Plans A, B, 3 and 4 (Sachin, 2026-10-31).** The dasha sequence is the same for everyone; only
  placements differ. So a planet's purpose comes from where it sits in the birth and divisional charts, and the running
  mahadasha, antardasha and sub-periods bring fulfilment, lack or delay. Read each planet: house, whose house, the
  dispositor and where it sits, every conjunction and drishti, and read from the other lagnas too (Indu, Hora and others).
  Fits doc 34's hierarchy; add the other-lagna readings to it.
- **Fable rewrite of the Sachin reading** from Radha tables after the deploy and re-pull.
- **Doc 39 follow-ups (2026-11-01).** `real_want` as a clarify question with chips (doc 33 §8 decision 1); Plan B buckets in the taxonomy; R14
  on by default (doc 18 gate); `predictions` and calibration (doc 32). All wait on Sachin's decisions or on labels.
- **Category flows (Sachin, 2026-10-31).** After that, specialised multi-agent flows per category, starting with romance,
  love and relationships, and finances (bank balance, financial luck, gains through career and business), then career,
  parents, legal. The Clarify agent detects the category, which triggers that flow, using stored kundli data or fetching
  what it needs from Radha. Not designed yet; builds on docs 33 and 34.
- **AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md for the Radha and web repos** (pointer files), awaiting Sachin's yes.

- **Multi-School Data Requirements (`docs/ASK-REQUIREMENTS.md`, 2026-10-31).** Full specification of must-have Radha data
  points across **Parashara**, **Jaimini / Pt. Sanjay Rath**, **Lunar Astro / Deepanshu Giri**, and **Tajaka/Muhurta**
  required for deep readings: all 5 Avastha systems (`avasthas` — *Baladi, Jagradadi, Deeptadi, Lajjitadi, Shayanadi*),
  explicit combustion/cazimi/varga conjunction orbs, Level 3 (Pratyantardasha) & Level 4 (Sookshma) for the Top 9 primary
  dashas (`dwisatpathi`, `narayana`, `tithi_ashtottari`, `sudasa`, `yogini`, `vimshottari`, `chara`, `patyayini`,
  `tithi_pravesha_dasha`), pre-computed `argala_matrix` on Lagna/`AL`/`UL`/`HL`/`IL`, Special Lagnas exact degrees & Indu
  Lagna 16-kala breakdown, Lunar Astro `khara_navamsa_64`, `khara_drekkana_22`, `bhrigu_bindu`, and `dispositor_chains`,
  Annual chart vargas + Tajaka aspects (`Ithasala`/`Ishrafa`), and fast-planet (`Su, Mo, Me, Ve`) transit contacts + daily
  Ashtakavarga Kakshya bindus for 1-month/3-month bank-visibility timing. Status: open (reading-dev / Radha).

- **Shipped (2026-10-31 — Multi-School Past Life Reading & Radha Avasthas/Charter):**
  - `AIAstra_Radha` (`feature/reading-p1` → `develop` → `release-candidate-staging`, pushed to `origin`): added `pyserve/avasthas_export.py` (`avasthas`, `calc_version: "1"`, 5 Avastha systems + proximity audit + Lunar Astro `khara_navamsa_64`/`khara_drekkana_22`/`bhrigu_bindu`/`dispositor_chains`/`pending_karma` + `dasha_charter` 5-vector charter & 9×9 Antardasha fruition matrix) and `correspondences` in `pyserve/reading_tables_export.py`.
  - `AIAstra_Server` (`feat/past-comprehensive-life-reading` → `develop`): added `house_counts` (`M16`), `reading_tables`, `avasthas`, `avasthas.d9/d10/d16/d24`, Level-3 dashas (`dasha.<name>.l3`), per-varga `dignities.d*`, `aspects.d*`, `relations.d*` (`M17`), `ensurePastReadingData`, and profile-scoped 18-Year Past Life Reading Flow (`src/reading/timeline/pastReadingFlow.ts` + `/api/timeline/past-reading` routes).
  - `AIAstra_WEB` (`feat/profile-past-life-reading` → `develop`): added `PastLifeReadingSection` inside `ProfileSection.tsx` with interactive accuracy scorecard and feedback notes.
  - Documentation & Readings: `docs/TECHNIQUE.md` (+ `.docx`), `docs/ASK-REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/reading-engine/36-sachin-reading-2026-10-28-reader-edition-hindi.md` (+ `.docx`), and `docs/reading-engine/37-sachin-18yr-retrospective-2008-2026.md` (+ `.docx`).
